// 1. Write a C++ program to reverse a given string. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: w3resource
// Sample Output: ecruoser3w


// 2. Write a C++ program to change every letter in a given string with the letter following it in the alphabet (ie. a becomes b, p becomes q, z becomes a). 
// Example:
// Sample Input: w3resource
// Sample Output: x3sftpvsdf


// 3. Write a C++ program to capitalize the first letter of each word of a given string. Words must be separated by only one space. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: cpp string exercises
// Sample Output: Cpp String Exercises


// 4. Write a C++ program to find the largest word in a given string. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: C++ is a general-purpose programming language.
// Sample Output: programming


// 5. Write a C++ program to sort characters (numbers and punctuation symbols are not included) in a string. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: python
// Sample Output: hnopty


// 6. Write a C++ program to check whether the characters e and g are separated by exactly 2 places anywhere in a given string at least once. 
// + Example:
// Sample Input: eagerer
// Sample Output: eagerer -> 1


// 7. Write a C++ program to count all the vowels in a given string. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: eagerer
// Sample output: number of vowels -> 4


// 8. Write a C++ program to count all the words in a given string. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: Python
// Sample Output: number of words -> 1


// 9. Write a C++ program to check whether two characters present equally in a given string. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: aabcdeef
// Sample Output: True


// 10. Write a C++ program to check if a given string is a Palindrome or not. 
// A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar.
// Example:
// Sample Input: madam
// Sample Output: True


// 11. Write a C++ program to find a word in a given string which has the highest number of repeated letters. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: Print a welcome text in a separate line.
// Sample Output: Word which has the highest number of repeated letters. separate


// 12. Write a C++ program to insert a dash character (-) between two odd numbers in a given string of numbers. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: 1345789
// Sample Output: Result-> 1-345-789


// 13. Write a C++ program to change the case (lower to upper and upper to lower cases) of each character of a given string. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: Pythpn
// Sample Output: pYTHON


// 14. Write a C++ program to find the numbers in a given string and calculate the sum of all numbers. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: w3resource from 2008
// Sample Output: Sum of the numbers: 2011


// 15. Write a C++ program to convert a givern non-negative integer to english words. 
// Example:
// Sample Input: 12
// Sample Output: Twelve
// Sample Input: 29
// Sample Output: Twenty Nine
